  "interpretation": "It is considered that a certain property of temperament is strongly developed in the subject if he received 9 or more points on it; poorly developed-if he received 4 or less points on it. If the total number of points is from 5 to 8, this property of temperament is considered average.The conclusion about the dominant type of human temperament is made on the basis of comparing the indicators obtained for different temperament properties with the typical combinations of these properties given below, corresponding to different temperament types.Sanguine - average developed indicators for all temperament characteristics. Choleric - high indicators of energy, pace and emotionality with medium or high indicators of plasticity. Phlegmatic - low indicators for all the properties of temperament. Melancholic - low indicators of energy, plasticity, pace with medium or high indicators of emotionality. A person belongs to the pure type of sanguine, choleric, phlegmatic or melancholic only if the degree of development of his indicators completely coincides with those associated with the described types. In all other cases, it is considered that a person has a so-called mixed type of temperament.",
