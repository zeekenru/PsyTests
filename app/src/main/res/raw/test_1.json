  "interpretation": "The indicator for each category is calculated as follows: each point of the scale is rated from 0 to 3 in accordance with the increase in the severity of the symptom. The total score is from 0 to 62 and decreases in accordance with the improvement of the condition: 0-9 – no depressive symptoms 10-15 – mild depression (subdepression), 16-19 – moderate depression. 20-29 – severe depression (moderate severity), 30-63-severe depression.A depression score of 19 points is considered a clinical disorder; a level higher than 24 points indicates the need for therapy-possibly with the use of antidepressants. The goal of treatment should be to achieve a level of depression below 10 points.",
