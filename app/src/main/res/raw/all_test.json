Beck in 1961 and developed on the basis of clinical observations that made it possible to identify a limited set of the most relevant and significant symptoms of depression and the most frequent complaints made by patients. After correlating this list of parameters with clinical descriptions of depression contained in the relevant literature, a questionnaire was developed that includes 21 categories of symptoms and complaints. Each category consists of 4-5 statements corresponding to specific manifestations/symptoms of depression. These statements are ranked as the specific contribution of the symptom to the overall severity of depression increases."

    "description": "The Beck Hopelessness Inventory Scale (abbreviated BHI) is a scale that measures the severity of negative attitudes towards the subjective future in adults and adolescents. The scale was developed by A. Beck and a group of his collaborators at the Center for Cognitive Therapy at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School (USA). The basis of this concept as a theoretical construct is the cognitive theory of mental processes, including depression as a consequence of cognitive delusions. When developing the scale, the authors followed the Stotland concept, in which hopelessness is considered as a system of cognitive schemes, a common feature for which is the negative coloring of expectations about the near and distant future. Beck's Hopelessness Scale measures the severity of a subject's negative attitude to their own future. This technique is of particular value as an indirect indicator of suicidal risk in patients suffering from depression, as well as in people who have previously attempted suicide."
