He acts on the spur of the moment, impulsive, quick-tempered, carefree, optimistic, good-natured, cheerful. Prefers movement and action, tends to be aggressive. Feelings and emotions do not have strict control, and are prone to risky actions. You can't always rely on him. Pintroversion is a set of directly opposite personality traits. The typical introvert is a calm, shy person who tends to introspect. Reserved and distant from everyone but close friends. Plans and considers his actions in advance, does not trust sudden impulses, takes decision-making seriously, likes everything in order. A person who is characterized by personal introversion, controls his feelings, it is not easy to get out of himself. Pessimistic, highly values moral norms. Neuroticism characterizes emotional stability or instability (emotional stability or instability)./ Emotional stability is a trait that expresses the preservation of organized behavior, situational purposefulness in ordinary and stressful situations. It is characterized by maturity, excellent adaptation, lack of great tension, anxiety, as well as a tendency to leadership, sociability. Neirotism is expressed in extreme nervousness, instability, poor adaptation, a tendency to quickly change moods (lability), feelings of guilt and anxiety, preoccupation, depressive reactions, distraction, instability in stressful situations. Neuroticism corresponds to emotionality, impulsivity; unevenness in contacts with people, variability of interests, self-doubt, pronounced sensitivity, impressionability, a tendency to irritability. Neurotic personality is characterized by inadequately strong reactions to the stimuli that cause them. Individuals with high scores on the neuroticism scale may develop neurosis in adverse stressful situations. Sincerity scale: high values on this scale indicate insincerity in responses. It may also indicate some demonstrative behavior, the desire to appear better in the eyes of other people, to express only socially approved opinions. If your result is considered doubtful or unreliable, try taking the test again, answering more openly, without thinking about the possible impression that your answers might make.",
