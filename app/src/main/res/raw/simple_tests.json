Who we become in life and how we behave largely depends on what motivates us. For you, the main driving force will be happiness and fulfillment of your potential, rather than success in your career. While many people find their happiness in a brilliant career, for you, it may be a strong family and a stable job that does not involve too much responsibility and brings regular income. No one can be happy if they are forced to be something they don't really want to be."

In addition to your family and career, you have other interests and hobbies in your life and are able to use your free time effectively. PVAs, in all likelihood, can be described as a person who is proud of his work and has certain ambitions in life. So if you have an opportunity to advance in your career, you will not miss it, but you will never fight hard for promotion, because your career is not the main role in your value system. The ability to maintain the right balance between career, family and everything else allows you to make the most of everything you have planned, both in your personal and professional life."

Career not only determines the way you live your life, you expect to use it to achieve well-being and, perhaps, even fame for yourself and your family. The difficulty lies in the fact that a person who is so absorbed in his own career forgets that there are other important things in life. Sometimes careerists, achieving heights in the profession, invest so much time and effort in their work that they become dependent on it and turn into real workaholics."

There is also reason to assume that you are not interested in new technologies, perhaps because you find it tedious to understand them. You constantly look back, remembering past times that seem so much better to you than the present, so you can be called a sentimental person. Most likely, you are pining and constantly remember a certain period of your life when everything was good and all the changes were only for the better. But if you now make an effort to change your worldview even a little, and try to find good moments in the present tense, then the future will appear to you in much more optimistic colors. And then, perhaps, the good times will return, and many years later, looking back, you will remember the present days with joy. Never forget that it is never too late to learn. Technological progress is going at a furious pace, but in most cases, technical innovations make life easier for us, rather than complicate it. So we have a choice: either we become part of the modern world with its technological progress, or we ignore the changes that are taking place and do not use the advantages provided to us."

It is the accumulated experience that allows us to make certain decisions today and forms the foundation on which we can build our future. The number of points you get indicates that you keep up with the times, are used to making plans for the future, follow the development of new technologies, but at the same time cherish your memories and past. You are in the most favorable position: you are not afraid of changes and do not give up on new technologies that will inevitably appear as a result of these changes. You are optimistic about the future, and at the same time with light sadness remember the past times.Other than that, you think that everything in your life has turned out as it should, and therefore there is no need to change anything, even if many people, such as friends, parents, teachers or colleagues, are constantly trying to teach you how to live. But in the end, this is your own life, and only you can decide how to live it. Any goals matter only if they are important to you, and you and only you should determine which path to choose and what to strive for."

You try to take any changes in your life positively; you are happy to implement your plans, which you always have in abundance, and the thought of opportunities opening up in the future excites the blood.In addition, you are very interested in all new technologies and you want that no new invention that has appeared on the market will pass you by. But in our time, technological progress is gaining such momentum that almost no one can keep up with it at least one step. So don't be discouraged if you suddenly find out that you don't know anything about any technical innovation, or it turns out that the computer you purchased just six months ago is no longer considered the most modern and powerful model. Your philosophy is that a person should constantly move forward and develop, no matter how old they are."

Since the norms of behavior in society often do not allow you to release emotions, for example, in a rude or cruel way, and also do not allow you to simply escape from an unpleasant situation, the tension inside you gradually accumulates, you become more vulnerable and experience severe stress. At such moments, existing problems are likely to appear to you many times more terrible than they really are. So you should remind yourself more often that most of the things we worry about will never happen, that many of our problems are solved fairly quickly, and that if we deal with difficulties intelligently and calmly, they will not leave any terrible traces in our lives. In fact, we are not the first to face difficulties and stressful situations; all people in the world at one time or another have to solve certain problems. You should also clearly understand that intense stress leads to stress, and because of it, various diseases arise. Therefore, it is very important to learn how to behave correctly in a critical situation: you need to take a step back, look from the outside at your problems, at your life in general, and try to find positive moments in it — and there will probably be many of them.Most importantly, try to form a more positive attitude towards life. It is said that in the modern world, people experience great stress, but in reality, life has never been easy, and previous generations also had to contend with many difficulties. Modern research and techniques should help us deal with problems better than people have done in the past. After all, we are now aware of the dangers of stressful situations.You should always analyze your problems, look for the cause or causes of your stress, learn to respond correctly, and find your own ways to deal with stress. You may also want to change your attitude to stress and difficulties, work on your behavior, for example, in work situations, find places where you can ask for help at the right time, and find the right people with whom you can discuss all the problems.In addition, it is very important to take care of yourself at a time when you have to solve important problems, not only for your own well-being, but also for the sake of those close to you. This can be done in different ways, for example: doing what is necessary at the moment, and do some fun things that will bring pleasure to you and your families; up be too hard on yourself, we all make mistakes; allow yourself a break; try to relax and sleep more; keep yourself in good physical shape; eat and drink as much as you need; do not forget about their own interests."

You're in a pretty good position: you are able to cope with yourself in times of stress and tension, but at the same time you can always refuse if you are offered conditions that are too difficult for you."

The only thing you should warn a person who has such valuable qualities is that he should still be prepared to face stressful situations that will make even him nervous, because in life this, unfortunately, is inevitable. In other words, you need to think about how you will act in times of stress, and understand that any unexpected situations are possible in life. Also, don't forget: some tension can even be beneficial, because difficulties force people to come together and show all their strengths."
